# LD_01 - Number Guessing Game
## Implementation Changes
I decided to change the implentation a bit to make it more user friendly.

I oriented myself on the **Wordle** Game.

Therefore, I dind't use following notation:
> User innput: 1234, Output: 0:0

Instead the numbers the user enters are shown in different colors correlating to their position and occurrence
* Green - The number occurs in the puzzle and is on the right position
* Yellow - The number occurs in the puzzle but isn't on the right position
* Red - The number doesn't occur in the puzzle

## Run the Game
To run the game simply run the `fun main()` function in the **main.kt** file (can be found in `src/main.kt`)
